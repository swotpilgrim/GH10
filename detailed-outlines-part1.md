  - Extended flashback: three days ago watching through binoculars as four Westside Kings held Kyle underwater, Derek Kane personally finishing him, Kyle's arms stopping their struggle, Tara screaming from beach too far away to help.
  - She pulled his body from water herself during lifeguard shift, performed CPR knowing he was already gone, felt his cold skin and seaweed in his hair, cops ruled it accidental drowning.
  - Present moment: Tara watches same surfers, same waves, thinks about Derek Kane drinking at beach bar while Kyle's in morgue, decides tonight she meets her brother for shooting lessons.

  - Shooting instruction: sight picture, trigger control, breathing, combat reload drills, Tara's competent quickly due to lifeguard hand strength and ocean-calm nerves, Danny surprised at her steadiness.
  - Danny tries talking her down (they'll kill you, cops will arrest you, Kyle wouldn't want this), Tara refuses (someone has to, beach community's terrified, Derek owns the cops), Danny realizes she's committed and stops arguing.
  - Danny teaches combat mindset: "They're already dead, you're just making it official," explains how to stay calm during violence, when to shoot, when to run, how to survive.
  - Danny gives her the .45, two spare magazines, box of fifty rounds, tells her to practice, returns to Camp Pendleton, both knowing this might be goodbye.

  - Tara swims out (lifeguard training, fast swimmer), reaches Kyle's floating body, drags him to shore, CPR on sand (compressions, rescue breathing), knows he's dead but can't stop trying, lifeguard partner calls ambulance.
  - Cops arrive, rule it accidental drowning (no witnesses willing to testify, gang intimidation), ambulance takes body, Tara at morgue later identifying Kyle, his face purple and cold, that image burned into her brain forever.

  - Tara scouts locations: drives to Seal Beach, watches The Break from car (Kings inside drinking, loud music, pool game), sees Razor leave on motorcycle (leather jacket, scar on cheek), follows him home.
  - She notes Razor's address, patterns (solo dawn surfer, creature of habit), plans approach (intercept during dawn session, ocean is her advantage), checks .45 (seven rounds plus two spare magazines).
  - Phone call with Danny from payphone (he's at Camp Pendleton), Danny gives tactical advice (first kill is hardest, make it clean, no hesitation), Tara sets alarm for 4 AM.

* Dialogue Topics: Jack's fear of Kings (they'll burn my shop if they know I talked), Tara's cold determination (I'm not asking you to help, just tell me where), Danny's advice (come from behind, control the environment, don't let him see it coming), small reconnaissance details.

  - Approaches Razor casual in parking lot (checking waves together, surf small talk), he doesn't recognize her (just another surfer girl), they paddle out together into dark water, 100 yards offshore.
  - Tara asks "You remember Kyle Sanders?" Razor's face changes (recognizes name, reaches for her), Tara faster: dives underwater, surfaces behind him, lifeguard rescue hold in reverse (arm across throat).
  - Underwater struggle: Razor thrashes and panics, tries to fight, Tara uses waves and current, holds him under during sets, stays calm while he drowns, takes three minutes, body goes limp.
  - She releases body (lets it drift, will wash up as "accidental drowning"), paddles to shore calm, drives away, showers at home (washing salt and evidence), hands shaking after.

* Dialogue Topics: Surf small talk (waves are shit, might get better at high tide, west swell coming), Kyle's name dropping (recognition, brief panic), Tara's whisper before drowning him (this is for Kyle, he remembers you holding him down).

  - Vince (right-hand man, Navy veteran, actually competent) counsels caution, suggests investigating, Derek dismissive (who's going to touch us, we own this beach), sends Vince to ask around anyway.
  - Tara on tower going through normal lifeguard routine (scanning water, radio checks, tourist questions), coworker notices she seems calmer now (think work is helping her grief), she plays bereaved girlfriend role.
  - Phone call from Danny (payphone on beach, Danny at Pendleton): "News says surfer drowned at Bolsa Chica," Tara confirms "One down," Danny silent acknowledgment, tells her be careful, she promises nothing.

* Dialogue Topics: Lifeguard radio chatter (routine check-ins, shark sighting south, fog rolling in), Kings' meeting (who killed Razor, someone's sending message, Derek's paranoia and cocaine rambling), Danny's check-in (you really did it, no going back now, call if you need exfil).

  - Approach: Tara walks under pier (shadows, structural posts, sand), Sticks sees her, doesn't register threat (lone woman, maybe customer), she closes distance fast.
  - Shooting: two rounds, chest and throat, Sticks goes down hard, drowning in own blood on sand, Tara stands over him briefly (confirms dead), walks away calm.
  - Disposal: drops .45 in ocean from pier (can't keep murder weapon, ballistics), drives to beach bonfire area (public bonfire pits), burns clothes in fire pit, watches flames consume evidence.

* Dialogue Topics: Drug deal overhead (hundred for the eight ball, pure shit, Derek's supply line), Sticks' final words (what the fuck, attempted threat), Tara says nothing (no conversation, just execution), internal monologue about shooting versus drowning.

* Emotional Arc: More confident than first kill, less hesitation, growing comfort with violence, brief consideration of method (shooting faster but noisier than drowning).

  - Kings stake out Tara's apartment (two-man team watching), her lifeguard tower (different team), Danny's known addresses (Pendleton contacts), spreading net.
