# BEACH BLOOD - Story Bible

## Story Premise

Tara Mitchell, 23-year-old lifeguard and surfer at Huntington Beach, watches her boyfriend Kyle—a rising pro surfer—drowned by the Westside Kings, a violent surf gang that controls Southern California's best breaks through intimidation, drug dealing, and brutal violence. The Kings hold Kyle under until his lungs fill with seawater, then claim it was a surfing accident. The entire beach community knows the truth but stays silent out of fear. Tara trades her surfboard for her Marine brother's service pistol and begins systematically hunting every member of the gang from Huntington to Malibu, using her lifeguard skills and intimate knowledge of the ocean to drown, shoot, and beat twenty-four men. The surf's up, the blood's in the water, and Tara Mitchell is delivering California justice one body at a time. This is pulp revenge in paradise—1977 SoCal beach culture meets hardboiled vigilante action.

## Protagonist Profile

**Tara Mitchell, 23.** Five-foot-seven, lean and athletic with sun-bleached blonde hair kept in a practical ponytail, tanned skin, and forearms corded with muscle from years of ocean rescues. Green eyes that used to be warm now carry something cold and distant. Wears cutoff jeans, bikini tops, lifeguard windbreakers, work boots when hunting. Body shows the life—scars on knees from reef wipeouts, rope-burned hands, muscled shoulders.

**Background:** Born and raised in Huntington Beach, daughter of a fisherman (dead from heart attack three years ago) and a waitress (still works Denny's night shift). Grew up in beach apartments, working-class surf culture, started surfing at eight with her older brother Danny before he enlisted Marines. High school graduate, never considered college—became lifeguard at nineteen, one of first women hired full-time at Huntington. Four years on the tower, pulled thirty-seven swimmers from riptides, performed CPR on seventeen, lost only two. Strong swimmer, expert in ocean conditions, knows every break, current, sandbar, and hazard from San Clemente to Zuma Beach. Was happy before Kyle died—surfed mornings, worked tower afternoons, beach bonfires at night.

**Skills Acquisition:** Ocean skills from lifetime surfing and four years professional lifeguarding—can swim in conditions that drown others, reads currents instinctively, knows how to hold someone underwater efficiently (rescue training in reverse). Combat skills from brother Danny—Marine grunt home from two tours, taught Tara to shoot in desert outside Riverside over three weekends. She's competent, not expert. Good with pistol at close range, understands basics (sight picture, trigger control, combat reload), but no military training. Fights dirty—eye gouges, groin strikes, whatever works. Lifeguard strength gives her edge against men who underestimate her.

**Personality:** Working-class authentic, straightforward, no patience for bullshit. Talks like beach locals—casual profanity, surf slang, clipped sentences. Before Kyle's death she was easygoing, laughed easily, loved the ocean more than anything. After: cold, mission-focused, capable of extreme violence without hesitation. Not crazy or unhinged—very clear about what she's doing and why. Sees Westside Kings as cancer on the beach community, cutting them out one by one. No guilt about killing men who deal heroin to teenagers and drown people for crossing them. Takes no pleasure in it, but no regret either.

**Motivation:** Kyle wasn't just boyfriend—he was her future. Pro surfer on the rise, planning to marry her after next competition season. Westside Kings drowned him because he refused to throw a surf contest Derek Kane had bet on. Tara saw them hold him under from the beach—too far away to help, screamed herself hoarse while Kyle's arms stopped thrashing. Pulled his body from the water herself, performed CPR she knew wouldn't work, felt his cold skin. That image drives her—Kyle's face purple, seaweed in his hair, ocean that was his life becoming his death. She's not coming back from this. Win or lose, Tara Mitchell died on that beach with Kyle. What's hunting the Kings is just the part that's still moving.

**Combat Capability:** Carries Colt .45 automatic (Danny's service pistol, seven-round magazine) in waistband or beach bag. Backup is .38 snubnose revolver (bought from pawn shop, five rounds). Competent shooter—not competition grade but combat effective within twenty feet. Drowning is her signature—knows how to control someone in water, use currents and waves, hold them under while they thrash. Strong enough to physically overpower most men in ocean environment where they panic and she doesn't. On land: brutal efficiency, no martial arts training, street-fighting dirty techniques. Knows her limitations—avoids prolonged gunfights, uses surprise and environment, retreats when outmatched. Lifeguard conditioning means she can run, swim, and fight longer than criminals expect.

## Villain Profile

**Derek Kane, 28.** Six feet tall, surfer's build gone soft from cocaine and money, shoulder-length dark hair with expensive cut, permanent sunburn across nose, teeth too white (capped). Wears custom wetsuits (black with gold trim), gold Rolex, designer sunglasses, always has entourage. Drives new Corvette Stingray, carries chrome-plated .357 Magnum he's never had to use personally—that's what the gang is for. Good-looking in that wealthy California way, smile like a shark, eyes like a reptile sizing up prey.

**Background:** Only son of real estate developer Thomas Kane (shopping malls, apartment complexes, strip clubs). Grew up in Newport Beach mansion, private schools, trust fund at sixteen. Was legitimately talented surfer in high school—could've gone pro but liked partying more than competition. Started Westside Kings at twenty-one as exclusive surf club, evolved into criminal gang when Derek discovered he enjoyed power more than waves. Uses daddy's money to fund operations, daddy's lawyers to avoid consequences, daddy's connections to corrupt local cops. Thomas Kane pretends not to know what his son does, collects rent from businesses Derek's gang extorts. Derek sees himself as king of the beach—controls who surfs where, who deals what, who lives or dies. Running a criminal empire is just extension of rich kid entitlement.

**Operation:** Westside Kings control premium surf breaks from Huntington to Malibu through violence and intimidation. Twenty-eight members (at story start), mostly rich kids playing gangster, some legitimately dangerous criminals Derek recruited. They deal cocaine and heroin at beach parties, extort surf shops and beachfront businesses (pay protection or get vandalized/burned), fix surf competitions (force pro surfers to throw contests for betting syndicates), run prostitution from beach hotels. Signature move: anyone who crosses them gets drowned—held underwater until dead, body dumped in ocean, ruled accidental. Cops know, don't care (some are paid off). Surf community terrified—Kings will kill your family, burn your shop, make you disappear.

**Evil M.O.:** Drowning is personal signature. Derek believes the ocean is his—disrespect him, die in his water. Forces victims underwater while gang holds them, watches them thrash and panic, pulls them up gasping, asks if they'll comply, drowns them when they refuse or just for entertainment. Kyle's drowning took four minutes—Derek personally held him under the final minute, laughing. Also uses beatings (baseball bats, boots, fists), occasional shooting (his lieutenant Vince handles this), arson against businesses. But drowning is the calling card—sends message that even the ocean obeys Derek Kane.

**Personality:** Entitled sociopath with movie-villain dialogue. Calls himself "King of the Coast," refers to ocean as "my domain," quotes Shakespearean lines about power (thinks it makes him sophisticated). Cocaine habit makes him paranoid and grandiose simultaneously. Charm when it serves him—can schmooze investors, seduce women, play the golden boy for daddy's country club friends. Vicious when crossed—no empathy, views people as possessions or obstacles. Quotable: "The ocean takes what I give it," "Every wave breaks for me," "You think you can swim in my water?" Collects surfboards as trophies, has Kyle's custom board mounted in his beach house.

**Weaknesses:** Arrogance—can't conceive that working-class lifeguard girl could threaten him. Cocaine paranoia makes him sloppy, reckless. Needs to be seen, craves attention and respect, shows up at public events (surf competitions, beach parties) despite danger. Trusts money to solve problems—throws cash at threats instead of recognizing real danger. Physical coward—never personally fought anyone without gang backing him up. Panic response in actual combat situations. Ego demands he attend big surf competition even when Tara's hunting his gang—can't let her scare him into hiding.

**Relationship to Protagonist:** Derek personally drowned Kyle, made it slow and deliberate. Tara knows his face, his laugh, his Corvette. He doesn't know who she is until bodies start dropping—just another beach girl to him, invisible. When he learns Tara's responsible, dismisses her (woman, lifeguard, nobody), sends gang members instead of taking seriously. By the time he realizes she's actually killing his entire operation, it's too late—she's already too close, too committed, too dangerous. Final confrontation is personal: Tara holds Derek underwater in the same break where Kyle died, watches him drown exactly like he drowned her boyfriend.

## Supporting Characters

**Kyle Sanders, 22 (deceased before story starts).** Pro surfer on the rise, sponsored by local surf shop, competed in Pacific Coast circuit. Tara's boyfriend of three years, planned to marry her after next season. Honest, talented, refused to throw competition for Derek's betting syndicate. Drowned in Chapter 3 (flashback)—Westside Kings held him under four minutes, Derek personally finished him. Body recovered by Tara during her lifeguard shift. Kyle's death is inciting incident, his ghost drives every action Tara takes. His custom surfboard is in Derek's beach house, motivating her final assault.

**Danny Mitchell, 26.** Tara's older brother, Marine Corps grunt, two tours infantry. Home on leave when Kyle dies, sees his sister broken, teaches her to shoot over three weekends in desert. Gives her his service .45, shows her combat reloads, basic pistol fighting. Knows she's going hunting, tries to talk her down, fails, accepts it. Provides intelligence on tactics, helps her plan first few kills. Returns to Camp Pendleton when leave ends, tells her "Make it count." Appears in several chapters as phone contact (Tara calls from payphones for advice). Struggles with guilt—enabled her war—but respects her choice. Character represents working-class military culture, tactical knowledge source.

**Razor (Real name: Marcus Webb), 24.** First kill target, Westside Kings member who actually held Kyle underwater. Surfer, dealer, violent enforcer. Scar across left cheek from knife fight, wears leather jacket even on beach, rides motorcycle. Competent fighter, underestimates Tara completely. She drowns him in Chapter 6—intercepts him during solo dawn surf session, uses lifeguard rescue hold in reverse, holds him under until he stops fighting. His death announces Tara's war. Body count: 1. Dies knowing exactly why—Tara whispers "Kyle Sanders" before final push underwater.

**Vincent "Vince" Maldonado, 32.** Derek's right-hand man, actually dangerous unlike most Kings. Navy veteran (dishonorable discharge for black market operations), knows combat, handles gang's serious violence. Carries sawed-off shotgun, .45 automatic, combat knife. Respects Tara as threat when bodies start dropping, counsels Derek to take her seriously (ignored). Competent tactician, dangerous opponent. Major antagonist through Act 2—hunts Tara while she hunts gang. Dies in Chapter 21 (pier shootout), nearly kills Tara first. She shoots him four times, he keeps coming, finally goes down. His death removes competent opposition, leaving only Derek and amateur thugs. Character provides legitimate threat, professional criminal versus amateur vigilante.

**Jack Brennan, 58.** Owner of Brennan's Surf Shop (Huntington Beach), knew Tara since childhood, sponsored Kyle's competition career. Pays extortion to Westside Kings, hates it, can't fight back (family to protect). Provides Tara with information—where Kings hang out, schedules, movements. Never directly helps violence, but intelligence source. Represents local business community quietly supporting her war. Derek burns his shop in Chapter 19 (retaliation for suspected cooperation), Jack loses everything but doesn't give Tara up to cops. She kills three Kings in response. Survives story, rebuilds shop with community help. Character shows beach community's silent complicity and support.

**Rita Chen, 19.** Prostitute controlled by Westside Kings, heroin addict, working beach hotels. Tara rescues her during Chapter 14 raid on hotel operation, gets her to women's shelter. Rita provides detailed intelligence on Derek's beach house, habits, security. Terrified of Kings, helps Tara because "someone finally fought back." Character represents victims of Kings' operation, humanizes stakes beyond Kyle's death. Survives story, enters rehab. Brief role but thematic importance—Tara's not just avenging Kyle, she's cutting out cancer hurting whole community.

## Setting Details

**Location:** Southern California coastline, Huntington Beach to Malibu, summer 1977. Post-Vietnam malaise meets California beach culture at its grittiest—before gentrification, when beaches had working-class danger underneath tourist postcards. Heroin creeping into surf scene, cocaine in beach clubs, bikies dealing speed from boardwalk bars.

**Huntington Beach (Primary Setting):** Working-class surf town, famous for consistent waves and rough reputation. Pier stretches 1,850 feet into Pacific (site of major shootout Chapter 18). Lifeguard headquarters: concrete building, radio tower, rescue equipment, smells like salt and zinc oxide. Tara's tower (#15) overlooks main break, hundred yards from where Kyle drowned. Beach apartments inland—two-story stucco buildings, permanent smell of fried food and marijuana, rent $180/month. Surf shops on Pacific Coast Highway: Brennan's, Duke's, Offshore—board racks outside, wax and resin smell inside, Dylan and Hendrix on 8-tracks. Beach at dawn: fog burning off, surfers checking waves, pelicans diving, marine layer muting colors to grays and blues. Night: bonfires in pits, cops patrolling boardwalk, fights breaking out at beach bars. Sound: constant wave crash, seagull cries, distant traffic on PCH.

**Derek's Territory:** Rich kid beaches—Newport, Laguna, Malibu. His beach house (Chapter 28 assault location) in Malibu colony: three-story glass and redwood, ocean-facing deck, Kyle's surfboard mounted on wall like hunting trophy, cocaine mirror on coffee table, chrome .357 in bedroom drawer. Westside Kings' hangout: beachfront bar called The Break (Seal Beach), dark interior even at noon, pool table, jukebox (Stones, Aerosmith, Zeppelin), Kings always at corner tables. Smell: beer and cigarette smoke, salt air through open doors. Site of Chapter 11 confrontation (Tara shoots two Kings during pool game).

**Tactical Geography:** Tara uses ocean like weapon—knows where riptides run (pulls victims out during fights), where rocks hide under surface (lures gang members into wipeouts), which piers provide cover (shootout positioning), where crowds gather (civilian shields). Beaches have social geography: locals versus tourists, surfer sections versus family zones, gang territory versus neutral ground. She navigates this invisibly—lifeguard uniform grants access everywhere, locals recognize her and stay silent, tourists don't notice until violence erupts.

**Period Details:** 1977 California: gas lines ending, punk rock emerging, skateboards replacing surfboards for some kids. Cars: VW vans, Ford trucks, Japanese imports appearing (Honda Civic, Datsun B-210). Pay phones on every corner (Tara uses for Danny calls—ten cents). No mobile phones, no GPS, everything analog. Surf culture: single-fin longboards transitioning to twin-fin shortboards, wetsuit technology primitive, surf magazines as only media coverage. Lifeguard equipment: rescue cans (red torpedo floats), landline radio only, manual log books. Weapons purchased cash from pawn shops, no background checks, no waiting periods. Beach culture: casual racism/sexism, working-class machismo, Vietnam vets sleeping rough on beaches, bikers and surfers overlapping, drugs everywhere but casual about it.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

**Prose Style:** Hard-boiled pulp efficiency—short sentences, active verbs, sensory concrete detail. No literary flourishes, no philosophical digressions, minimal description unless tactically relevant. Reads like 1976 Pinnacle Books Executioner novel transplanted to California beach. Fast pacing, action-focused, working-class vocabulary. Comparisons to ocean and surf (waves of violence, riptide of revenge, etc.) but not overwrought.

**Tara's Internal Voice:** Minimal introspection—she's not analyzing herself, she's executing mission. Thoughts tactical: "Three guys, two exits, pistol has six rounds." Emotional beats brief and physical: "Chest tight, hands steady, Kyle's face behind her eyes." Working-class direct: "Fuck Derek Kane. Fuck his gang. Fuck anyone protecting them." No victim mentality, no second-guessing, no guilt spirals. She knows exactly what she's doing and why. Internal voice sounds like laconic cop or soldier—detached professionalism over grief.

**Dialogue Style:** Beach culture 1977—casual profanity ("shit," "fuck," "asshole" common), surf slang ("gnarly," "bitchin'," "kook"), working-class directness. Tara speaks simply: "Where's Derek?" "I'm going to kill you now." "Kyle Sanders says hello." Derek speaks like movie villain: quotable, grandiose, cocaine-fueled rambling. Danny (Marine brother) speaks in military shorthand: "Roger that," "Two to the chest," "Negative." Supporting characters have distinct speech—Jack (surf shop owner) talks business and waves, Rita (prostitute) talks desperate and damaged.

**Violence Description:** Graphic but not gratuitous—detail serves tactical purpose, body counts matter, deaths have weight. Drowning scenes: describe struggle, panic, water filling lungs, body going slack. Gunshots: caliber matters, wounds described (entry/exit, blood spray, immediate vs. delayed death). Fights: brutal efficiency, no honor, eye gouges and groin strikes. Post-violence: Tara doesn't dwell, moves to next target. Reader feels impact without torture-porn excess.

**Pacing Reference:** Every chapter advances plot or body count. No slow introspective chapters, no lengthy flashbacks (Kyle's death shown once, referenced after). Action set pieces every 3-4 chapters minimum. Between action: tactical planning, intelligence gathering, brief character moments (phone call with Danny, conversation with Jack). Like waves: build, crest, crash, brief lull, build again.

## Weapons & Tactics

**Primary Weapon:** Colt M1911A1 .45 automatic—Danny's Marine Corps service pistol, seven-round magazine, .45 ACP ammunition. Heavy recoil, large caliber, stops targets immediately. Tara carries two spare magazines (21 rounds total), practices reload drills. Effective range for her skill: 20 feet accurately, 50 feet combat effective. Kept in beach bag when lifeguarding, waistband when hunting. Cleaned religiously (Danny taught her maintenance). She's not expert marksman—misses under stress, runs dry during pier shootout (Chapter 18), but competent enough for close-quarters combat.

**Backup Weapon:** Smith & Wesson .38 Special snubnose revolver—purchased cash from Riverside pawn shop ($65), five-round cylinder. Ankle holster or jacket pocket. When .45 runs dry or situation requires concealment. Shorter effective range, less stopping power, but reliable. Uses standard .38 rounds (no hollow points—too expensive, hard to source).

**Improvised Weapons:** Surf wax (slippery floors during fight), rescue can (blunt weapon—aluminum torpedo float, heavy), lifeguard knife (cut ropes/wetsuits, throat cutting when necessary), beach bonfire coals (thrown in face). Chapter 16: uses rescue buoy to choke gang member unconscious before drowning. Tara thinks tactically about environment—everything is potential weapon.

**Drowning Technique:** Lifeguard training in reverse—knows how to control panicking swimmer, apply holds, use currents. Approach from behind, arm across throat (rescue hold), pull victim backward into water, use their panic against them. In surf: duck under waves while holding victim surface-level (waves push them down, she stays under control). Riptide: position victim in current, let ocean do work while maintaining control. Takes 2-4 minutes depending on victim's conditioning. Tara's ocean experience means she can hold breath, stay calm, wait them out. Most victims drown faster than Kyle did—she's efficient, not cruel.

**Tactical Approach:** Ambush predator, not frontal assault specialist. Scouts targets, learns patterns, strikes when isolated. Uses dawn/dusk (low light, fewer witnesses), crowds (disappears after shooting), ocean (her environment, their hazard). Avoids prolonged gunfights—shoot fast, relocate, disappear. Post-kill: dumps weapons in ocean if necessary (loses .38 after Chapter 11 bar shooting, retrieves spare). No hesitation, no warnings, no mercy—targets are dead men who don't know it yet.

**Limitations:** Limited ammunition (carries what she has, no infinite magazines), not trained for tactical combat (no cover discipline, no room clearing), physically smaller than male opponents (compensates with surprise and environment), no body armor or backup. She's amateur vigilante, not operator—wins through determination, intimate location knowledge, and willingness to die trying.

## Themes

**Primary Theme:** Revenge as working-class justice when law fails. Beach community knows Westside Kings are cancer—deal drugs to teenagers, extort honest businesses, murder with impunity. Cops are paid off or don't care. Nobody with power stops Derek Kane because daddy's money buys immunity. Tara represents community's repressed desire to fight back—she does what they can't. Her violence is satisfying because it's deserved, targeted, proportional. Not philosophically complex—simple recognition that sometimes only violence answers violence.

**Justice Versus Law:** Tara breaks every law (murder, weapons possession, vigilantism) but delivers justice. Cops appear periodically, investigate drownings and shootings, never catch her because community doesn't cooperate. Locals see her as hero, protect her through silence. Lifeguard who saves lives becomes killer—paradox resolved by recognizing some lives (Kings) forfeit right to exist. Theme manifests in action: Jack's surf shop burned (Chapter 19), Tara kills three Kings in response same night, Jack doesn't give her up when cops question him.

**The Ocean as Judge:** Water that gives life (Tara's lifeguard work, Kyle's surfing passion) also takes it (Kyle's drowning, Tara's weapon). Ocean is neutral force—Tara uses it for revenge, Derek used it for murder. Climax occurs in same break where Kyle died (poetic justice). Tara's final act: holding Derek underwater until he drowns, ocean reclaiming what he corrupted. Theme not heavy-handed—manifests through setting and action, not dialogue.

**Working-Class Versus Wealth:** Derek represents entitled rich criminals who buy immunity. Tara represents working people who suffer and bleed. Every dead King is small victory against money's power. Beach community (surf shops, lifeguards, local surfers) quietly supports Tara because she fights enemy they can't touch. Theme shows in details: Derek's Corvette versus Tara's rusty pickup, his beach house versus her apartment, his lawyers versus her .45. Pulp simplicity: money can't buy safety from someone with nothing left to lose.

**Resolution:** Tara wins (Derek dead, gang destroyed) but doesn't walk away clean. She's killed twenty-four men, broken every law, sacrificed normal life. Returns to lifeguard tower (Chapter 30) but she's legend now, separate from community she saved. Got justice for Kyle but can't bring him back. Theme's answer: revenge satisfies but doesn't heal. She'd do it again—worth the cost—but cost was real.
